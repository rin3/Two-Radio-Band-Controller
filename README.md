#ZUYmaster ~ a two radio band controller ~
##Overview
A band controller designed for use with two radio HF contesting environment such as SO2R, M/S and M/2.
##Limitations
This implimentation only works for a combination of two each of newer Kenwood/ICOM exciters, ICE-419B band pass filters and ICOM IC-PW1 amplifiers.
##The circuit
The circuit consists of three boards:
-	1 - Arduino Mega 2560 board
-	1 - A Mega shield PCB with BPF I/F and IC-PW1 I/O
-	1 - Another PCB for exciter (Kenwood/ICOM) I/O

##Schemes
